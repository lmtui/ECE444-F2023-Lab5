Pro’s of TDD:
Test-Driven Development (TDD) elevates the quality and reliability of software created in its process. In Test-Driven Development cycle tests are created regularly by the developers. By making sure tests are created before the actual code, developers gain a clear understanding of requirements, ensuring their code functions as intended from the beginning. This approach results in more modular and maintainable code that also reduces debugging time. TDD allows developers to be aware of potential issues, through this process they have been identified and addressed possible bugs earlier in the development process. This allows for a more streamlined, structured debugging process. Moreover, the suite of tests serves as a critical safety net, enabling simplified refactoring and continuous integration, and effectively acting as living documentation that details how the system operates.

Con’s of TDD:

While TDD offers a structured approach to coding, it introduces overhead that may not always be justified. The process of writing all of the test cases and ensuring that they are inline and fully encapsulates the project requirement can slow down the developmental process adding to the project’s timeline. For developers unfamiliar with the TDD, there's a steep learning curve, which can hinder productivity. Additionally, the emphasis on unit tests can sometimes overshadow the importance of other testing forms like integration or system tests. As the software evolves as and scales, maintaining and updating the test suite can become a large task, leading to potential neglect. There's also the inherent risk of incomplete test coverage, giving developers a false sense of security while undetected issues are unintentionally created.
